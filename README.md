#Digital Twin–Based Industrial Automation System
##Overview

The Digital Twin–Based Industrial Automation System is a software engineering project that focuses on creating a virtual representation of a physical industrial system. This virtual model, known as a digital twin, mirrors the behavior and state of the real system using collected operational data. The project demonstrates how digital twins can support monitoring, analysis, and a better understanding of industrial processes.

##Motivation

Modern industries require systems that are efficient, reliable, and capable of responding quickly to changes. Traditional monitoring approaches often provide limited insight into how industrial systems behave. Digital twins address this limitation by offering a virtual environment where system performance can be observed and studied without affecting real-world operations. This project is motivated by the increasing demand for smart and data-driven industrial solutions.

##Project Description

The system creates a digital model of an industrial setup and continuously updates it using data obtained from the physical system. The digital twin reflects current operating conditions and allows users to observe system behavior over time. By comparing expected behavior with real data, the system helps identify unusual or inefficient operations.

##Functionality Overview

The project enables real-time observation of system parameters and stores operational data for later analysis. It provides basic visual representations of system status and supports simple simulations to understand how changes in operating conditions may affect performance. Indicators are generated when abnormal behavior is detected.

##Applications

This system can be applied in industrial monitoring, early fault detection, performance evaluation, and educational demonstrations. It is particularly useful in environments where directly testing changes on physical machines may be costly or risky.

##Project Status

This project is currently under development and represents an academic implementation intended to demonstrate digital twin concepts rather than a full-scale industrial solution.

##License

This project is intended for educational and learning purposes.
